# Image Loading Solution Documentation

## Problem Summary
We had issues with certain timestamp-based image files not loading correctly, specifically:
- `1747175977747-playground-poise.jpeg`
- `1747175912709-diverse-perspectives-campus-connections.jpeg`

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by two factors:
1. Next.js dynamic API route synchronous parameter access warning
2. Difficulties in resolving the proper path for the images in Nextcloud storage

## Solution Overview

### 1. Fixed the Next.js Synchronous Params Warning
- Changed the code to extract the filename from the URL pathname instead of directly accessing `params.filename`
- Added proper error handling with the same approach in the catch block

### 2. Enhanced Image Loading Strategy for Problematic Files
- Added special case handling for known problematic timestamp-based filenames
- Created a multi-stage loading strategy that tries different path variations:
  - Direct filenames without timestamps
  - Various path formats with different capitalization
  - Full path variations matching Nextcloud's directory structure

### 3. Improved Error Handling and Logging
- Added comprehensive error handling and detailed logging
- Implemented logging of successful path mappings for future reference
- Preserved compatibility with Vercel deployment environment

## Technical Details

### Special Case Handling for Problematic Images
We created a direct mapping for known problematic files to try multiple alternative paths.
For example, for `1747175977747-playground-poise.jpeg`, we try:
- `playground-poise.jpeg`
- `/Photos/playground-poise.jpeg`
- `/photos/playground-poise.jpeg`
- `/Portfolio/playground-poise.jpeg`
- `/Photos/Portfolio/playground-poise.jpeg`
- Plus additional capitalization variations

### Path Resolution Sequence
1. Try special case paths for known problematic files
2. Check local filesystem (public/photos directory)
3. Look up database records and try Nextcloud
4. Try alternative path formats with Nextcloud
5. Use fallback test images if all else fails
6. Return placeholder image as a last resort

### Testing and Verification
We created a verification script (`verify-image-loading.js`) that confirms both problematic images load correctly with proper content-type headers and valid image data.

## Recommendations for Future Improvements
1. Create a mapping database or cache for successful path resolutions
2. Implement a more robust path normalization system for Nextcloud integration
3. Consider adding server-side caching for frequently accessed images
4. Add monitoring for image loading performance and failure rates
