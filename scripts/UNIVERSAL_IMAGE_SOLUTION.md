# Universal Image Loading Solution

This document explains the implementation of the universal image loading solution for the portfolio website, which resolves issues with specific problematic images not loading correctly.

## Problem Summary

Previously, images like `1747175977747-playground-poise.jpeg` and `1747175912709-diverse-perspectives-campus-connections.jpeg` were not loading correctly due to:

1. Path inconsistencies between database records and actual Nextcloud storage locations
2. Timestamp prefixes in filenames causing path resolution issues
3. Next.js synchronous params access error in the dynamic API route

## Solution Implementation

The solution employs a universal approach that works for all images without special case handling:

### 1. Improved API Route

The API route in `src/app/api/photos/[filename]/route.ts` has been enhanced to:

- Extract filenames safely from URL pathname to avoid synchronous params access errors
- Generate comprehensive search paths for any image filename
- Try multiple search strategies in a consistent order

### 2. Intelligent Path Generation

The `generateSearchPaths` function creates a comprehensive set of path variations for any filename:

- Handles timestamp-prefixed filenames (e.g., "1747175977747-playground-poise.jpeg")
- Extracts base filenames without timestamps when present
- Tests multiple folder structures and capitalization patterns
- Removes duplicate paths to optimize performance

### 3. Multi-Strategy Approach

The image loading process follows these strategies in order:

1. **Local Files First**: Check if the image exists in the public/photos directory
2. **Database Records**: Check database for matching records and try to download from Nextcloud
3. **Path Variations**: Try all generated search paths with Nextcloud
4. **Fallback**: Use a placeholder image if all else fails

## Benefits

- **Universal Solution**: No special case handling required for problematic images
- **Future-Proof**: Handles timestamp prefixes and path variations automatically
- **Performance Optimized**: Tries local files first, then database paths, then variations
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully falls back to placeholders when images cannot be found

## Verification

The solution has been verified using dedicated test scripts:

- `scripts/verify-image-loading.js`: Tests previously problematic images
- `scripts/verify-universal-solution.js`: Tests a broader range of image types

Both tests confirm that all images now load correctly, including the previously problematic ones.

## Recommendations for Future Images

To ensure optimal performance:

1. Store all images with consistent paths in the database (preferably `/api/photos/[filename]`)
2. When uploading new images, follow consistent naming patterns
3. Consider removing timestamp prefixes from filenames when storing in Nextcloud

## Conclusion

The universal image loading solution successfully resolves all identified issues with image loading and provides a robust foundation for handling future images regardless of their naming patterns or storage locations.
